  diminishing_returns:
    # Diminishing returns reduce the amount of enchanting experience you get depending on the amount of a specific
    # mob you have killed. Each kill of a mob in the category "on" increases the player's tally counter by 1,

    # multiplied by the value specified in "multiplier". After enchanting, the tally counter is reduced by the "amount"
    # until the tally counter is below the "amount".
    # Example: a player kills 55 endermen. The next 5 times the player enchants something, their skill experience rewarded
    # is reduced to only 20% (multiplier of 0.2). Now their tally counter is 5 instead of 55, so their experience isn't reduced.
